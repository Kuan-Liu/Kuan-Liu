## Hello World 

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in Health Services Research (outcomes and evaluation method emphasis) at University of Torontoâ€™s Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, starting July 1, 2021.

My research interest is on applied Bayesian analysis, causal inference and longitudinal data analysis. I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum.  

Besides academic and fun R coding, I love watercolour painting and enjoys taking contemporary dance classes in Toronto. This past weekend, I made a major life decision and put down a deposite to purchase a YAMAHA U1 piano. I am pretty active on Twitter, feel free to message me!
