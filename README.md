## Hello World 

I am an Assistant Professor in Health Services Research (outcomes and evaluation method emphasis) at University of Torontoâ€™s Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation.

My research interest is on applied Bayesian analysis, causal inference and longitudinal data analysis. I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum. Besides academic work and creating fun data visualizations in R, I love watercolour painting, taking contemporary dance classes in Toronto, and playing piano as an adult beginner. 

I am pretty active on Twitter, feel free to message me!
