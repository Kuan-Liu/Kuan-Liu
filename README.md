I am a sixth year doctoral candidate in Biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Although I have heard lockdown is not the excuse to ask PhD students when they are going to graduate, I am happy to share my final oral exam is scheduled on June 14th, 2021. 

My research interest is in Applied Bayesian analysis, causal inference and longitudinal data. I am pretty active on Twitter, feel free to message me!
